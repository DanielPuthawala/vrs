# VMC Collaborators

The genesis of the GA4GH VR project was the Variation Modelling
Collaboration (VMC), which was formed as a collaboration of members of
ClinGen, ClinVar, FHIR, and GA4GH.  In 2017, the VMC group was
absorbed into the GA4GH and underwent a major membership change.
GA4GH's VR-Spec borrowed heavily from the VMC effort.  We thank the
following VMC Collaborators for their contributions.

* Gil Alterovitz, Harvard Medical School/Boston Children’s Hospital, FHIR Genomics
* Larry Babb, Sunquest, ClinGen
* Karen Eilbeck, University of Utah
* Bob Freimuth, Mayo Clinic, ClinGen, HL7/FHIR
* Reece Hart, Invitae, GA4GH, chair
* Sarah Hunt, Ensembl
* David Kreda, Harvard Medical School, FHIR Genomics
* Jennifer Lee, NCBI, ClinVar
* Peter Robinson, Jackson Laboratory, HPO
* Shawn Rynearson, University of Utah, UCGD
