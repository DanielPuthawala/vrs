  # Interval

  Interval:
    additionalProperties: false
    description: >-
      An Interval represents a span of sequence. Positions are
      always represented by contiguous spans using interbase
      coordinates.

      This definition of Interval is intended to be compatible with that
      in Sequence Ontology
      ([SO:0000001](http://www.sequenceontology.org/browser/current_svn/term/SO:0000001)),
      with the exception that the GA4GH VR Interval may be
      zero-width. The SO definition is for an "extent greater than
      zero".

  # Basic types
  # These types are used solely within other definitions.

  DateTime:
    additionalProperties: false
    type: string
    format: "date-time"

  CURIE:
    additionalProperties: false
    description: >-
      A string that refers to an object uniquely.  The lifetime and
      scope of an id is defined by the sender.

      VR does not impose any contraints on strings used as ids in
      messages. However, to maximize sharability of data, the VR
      Specification RECOMMENDS that implementations use [W3C Compact
      URI (CURIE)](https://www.w3.org/TR/curie/) syntax.

      String CURIEs are represented as `prefix`:`reference` (W3C
      terminology), but often referred to as `namespace`:`accession`
      or `namespace`:`local id` colloquially.

      The VR specification also RECOMMENDS that `prefix` be defined in
      identifiers.org.

      The `reference` component is an unconstrained string.

      A CURIE is a URI.  URIs may *locate* objects (i.e., specify
      where to retrieve them) or *name* objects conceptually.  VR uses
      CURIEs primarily as a naming mechanism.

      Implementations MAY provide CURIE resolution mechanisms for
      prefixes to make these objects locatable.

      Using internal ids in public messages is strongly discouraged.

# Enumeration types

enums:
  Completeness:
    type: string
    description: >-
      Declares the `completeness` of a Haplotype or Genotype
      definition.  See descriptions in those schemas for additional
      information.
      * COMPLETE: The definition is complete. All data are included
        for the covered assay.
      * PARTIAL: The definition is intentionally incomplete, typically
        to protect information.  Declaring partial variation allows
        data submitters to convey that data are missing.
      * UNKNOWN: The definition is not known to be either COMPLETE or
        PARTIAL.
    enum:
    - UNKNOWN
    - PARTIAL
    - COMPLETE
