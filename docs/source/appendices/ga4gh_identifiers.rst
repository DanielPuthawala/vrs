Proposal for GA4GH-wide Computed Identifier Standard
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Independence from VR proposal

	  The Variation Representation team created the computed
	  identifier scheme for VR objects.  However, this scheme is
	  applicable and useful to the entire GA4GH ecosystem.  As a
	  result, we are proposing that the computed identifier scheme
	  described here be considered for adoption as a GA4GH-wide
	  standard.  For this reason, we have adopted the use of the
	  `ga4gh` prefix above.



adv for adopting now: sets standard and enables VR adopters to use
future-proof ids

Rationale
- coherence
- shared objects (e.g., sequence)
- shared tools

Specific proposal
- truncated digest called GA4GH Digest
- identifier GA4GH Identifier
- namespace
- type prefix administration
