Interval
!!!!!!!!

**Biological definition**

None.

**Computational definition**

The *Interval* abstract class defines a range on a :ref:`sequence`,
possibly with length zero, and specified using
:ref:`interbase-coordinates`. An Interval may be a
:ref:`SimpleInterval` with a single start and end coordinate.
:ref:`Future Location and Interval types <planned-locations>` will
enable other methods for describing where :ref:`variation` occurs. Any
of these may be used as the Interval for Location.

.. _SimpleInterval:

SimpleInterval
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

**Computational definition**

An :ref:`Interval` with a single start and end coordinate.

**Information model**

.. csv-table::
   :header: Field, Type, Label, Description
   :align: left

   type, string, required, Interval type; must be set to 'SimpleInterval'
   start, uint64, required, start position
   end, uint64, required, end position

**Implementation guidance**

* Implementations MUST require that 0 ≤ start ≤ end. In the case of double-stranded DNA, this constraint holds even when a feature is on the complementary strand.

**Notes**

* VR uses Interbase coordinates because they provide conceptual
  consistency that is not possible with residue-based systems (see
  :ref:`rationale <interbase-coordinates-design>`). Implementations
  will need to convert between interbase and 1-based inclusive
  residue coordinates familiar to most human users.
* Interbase coordinates start at 0 (zero).
* The length of an interval is *end - start*.
* An interval in which start == end is a zero width point between two residues.
* An interval of length == 1 may be colloquially referred to as a position.
* Two intervals are *equal* if the their start and end coordinates are equal.
* Two intervals *intersect* if the start or end coordinate of one is
  strictly between the start and end coordinates of the other. That
  is, if:

   * b.start < a.start < b.end OR
   * b.start < a.end < b.end OR
   * a.start < b.start < a.end OR
   * a.start < b.end < a.end
* Two intervals a and b *coincide* if they intersect or if they are
  equal (the equality condition is required to handle the case of two
  identical zero-width Intervals).

**Examples**

* <start, end>=<*0,0*> refers to the point with width zero before the first residue.
* <start, end>=<*i,i+1*> refers to the *i+1th* (1-based) residue.
* <start, end>=<*N,N*> refers to the position after the last residue for Sequence of length *N*.
* See example notebooks in the :ref:`reference implementation documentation <impl-vr-python>`.
