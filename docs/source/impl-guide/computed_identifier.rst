Computed Identifiers
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

The VR-Spec provides an algorithmic solution to deterministically
generate a globally unique identifier from a VR object itself. All
valid implementations of the VR Computed Identifier will generate the
same identifier when the objects are identical, and will generate
different identifiers when they are not. The VR Computed Digest
algorithm obviates centralized registration services, allows
computational pipelines to generate "private" ids efficiently, and
makes it easier for distributed groups to share data.

A VR Computed Identifier is computed as follows:

* :ref:`Serialize <serialization>` the object into binary data.
* :ref:`Generate a digest <digest>` from the binary data.
* :ref:`Construct an identifier` based on the digest and object type.

The following diagram depicts the operations necessary to generate a
computed identifier.  These operations are described in detail in the
subsequent sections.

.. _serialization:

VR Serialization
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

.. important:: This section discusses VR Serialization.  Although VR
   serialization and JSON serialization appear similar, they are NOT
   interchangeable.


In the context of generating a Computed Identifier, serialization
converts a VR object into a binary representation.  Because the result
will be used to generate a digest, VR implementations MUST serialize
data identically.  The VR-Spec provides validation tests to ensure
compliance.

The criteria for the VR serialization method was that it must be
relatively easy and reliable to implement in any common computer
language.  Although several proposals exist ([1]_, [2]_, [3]_) for
serializing arbitrary data in a consistent manner, none have been
ratified. As a result, VR-Spec defines a custom serialization format
that is consistent with these proposals but does not rely on them for
definition.

The first step in serialization is to generate message content that:

    * MUST replace nested identifiable objects (i.e., objects that
      have id properties) with their corresponding ids
    * MUST order arrays of Ids by Unicode Character Set values
    * MUST require that all arrays of ids are CURIE formatted and use the
      `ga4gh` namespace prefix
    * MUST NOT include id fields
    * MUST NOT include null values


The second step is to serialize the message content as JSON that:

    * MUST be encoded in UTF-8
    * MUST NOT include insignificant whitespace, as defined in `RFC8259ยง2
      <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8259#section-2>`__
    * MUST order all keys by Unicode Character Set values
    * MUST use two-char escapes when available, as defined in `RFC8259ยง7
      <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8259#section-7>`__

.. _ga4gh-digest:

Digest
@@@@@@

Computing digests for identifiable VR objects consists of three steps:

1. Compute the `SHA-512`_ digest of a binary object.
2. Truncate the digest to the left-most 24 bytes (192 bits).  See
   :ref:`truncated-digest-collision-analysis` for the rationale for 24
   bytes.
3. Encode the truncated digest as a base64url_ ASCII string.


.. code-block:: python

   >>> import base64, hashlib
   >>> blob = b"ACGT"
   >>> digest = hashlib.sha512(blob).digest()
   >>> digest
   b'h\xa1x\xf7\xc7@\xc5\xc2@\xaag\xbaA\x84;\x11\x9d;\xf9\xf8 ...
   >>> base64.urlsafe_b64encode(digest[:24]).decode("ASCII")

.. _ga4gh-identifier:

Identifier Construction
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

A `W3C CURIE <curie-spec>`_ format has the form::

    prefix ":" reference

The GA4GH VR Spec constructs computed identifiers as follows::

    "ga4gh" ":" <type_prefix> "." <digest>

Type prefixes used by VR are:

.. csv-table::
   :header: type_prefix, VR Spec class name
   :align: left

   SQ, Sequence
   VA, Allele
   VL, Location
   VT, Text
   VH, (reserved) Haplotype
   VG, (reserved) Genotype
   VX, (reserved) Translocation

For example::

    ga4gh:SQ.v_QTc1p-MUYdgrRv4LMT6ByXIOsdw3C_


.. note:: Do not confuse the W3C CURIE `prefix` ("ga4gh" in this case)
          with a prefix used to indicate type.










----

scraps

* if the object is an Allele, normalize as described in
  :ref:`normalization`

The VR Computed Identifier algorithm applies only to *identifiable*
objects, that is, objects with an `id` property.  In addition, the
algorithm is defined only when nested objects use `ga4gh` identifiers.
For example, generating a Computed Identifier for an Allele requires a
Computed Identifier for the embedded location, which requires that the
reference sequence is defined using a Computed Identifier.


In addition, the VR Computed Identifier is explicitly NOT defined
(that is, invalid) if used with any other normalization,
serialization, or digest mechanism to generate a GA4GH Computed
Identifier.



.. note:: **Proposal for GA4GH-wide use**

   The Variation Representation team created the computed
   identifier scheme for VR objects.  However, this scheme is
   applicable and useful to the entire GA4GH ecosystem.  As a
   result, we are proposing that the computed identifier scheme
   described here be considered for adoption as a GA4GH-wide
   standard.  For this reason, we have adopted the use of the
   `ga4gh` prefix above. 

   If the Computed Identifier scheme is adopted as a GA4GH-wide
   standard, documentation and type prefixes would moved from the VR
   specification to a separate repository for GA4GH-wide use.



The VR Computed Identifier algorithm uses two well-established
standard algorithms, the SHA-512 hash function, which generates a
binary digest from binary data, and Base64 URL encoding, which encodes
binary data using printable characters.
